    <string name="app_book_page_1">Jeff was on a road trip, passing through a scary forest when his car broke down in the middle of no where</string>
    <string name="app_book_page_2">He started traveling into the woods, searching for any kind of help. He hears a strange noise and looks behind him.</string>
    <string name="app_book_page_3">Oh no! Standing behind him was a big, mean, tall bigfoot! Jeff stands still frozen in shock as the creature approaches him. The bigfoot reaches out and grabs him.</string>
    <string name="app_book_page_4">Suddenly the bigfoot gives the man a big hug and asks if he is okay. The man is shocked and is hesitant when he explains he is lost and his car broke down.</string>
    <string name="app_book_page_5">The bigfoot then takes Jeff back to his cabin where he makes Jeff dinner, and explains how everyone is always afraid when they see him, but he is friendly. He then shows Jeff where the nearest town is in the morning.</string>
